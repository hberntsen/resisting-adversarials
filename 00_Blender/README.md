This folder contains the 3D models we used in our experiments. The Python code to render images from many different 
viewpoints is inside the blender files. The result is an HDF5 dataset with the image pixels and the used viewpoints.

The suzanne model comes from [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
itself, the aeroplane model from [TF3DM](http://tf3dm.com/3d-model/antonov-an-71-no-texture-77342.html) and the tux model is was 
downloaded from [Kator Legaz's website](https://web.archive.org/web/20151014015438/http://www.katorlegaz.com/3d_models/miscellaneous/0167/index.php).
